            <h1>Learn easier</h1>
            <h2>How to learn faster without having to put in too much effort?</h2>
            <p>I know for a fact that no one likes it when they learn something for a lot of time and are still not able to understand. It is hard to accept, but if no one can accept the fact that something can be difficult to learn, we aren't going to get far. There are ways to learn easier and faster than just reading an article multiple times without any strategy. Here are a few ways to make your learning process faster, no matter what you're learning, a library or a math formula.</p>
            <h3>1. Pretend to explain to someone after reading an article</h3>
            <p>This method might seem a bit funny at first, but it can help you find out how much you know about the article you have read. Lets say you finished readinng a long paragraph/article on a javascript function and want to know how much you know about it. You could use this method. Just explain what you have learned after reading this article. If you get stuck at some point, for example you forget the syntax of the function, or the parameters required for this function, you just re-read the part of the article where that information can be found. Teaching someone (or pretending to teach someone) is a very good exercise and is usually better than answering questions about the topic you have read, because questions might not cover everything you have read.</p>
            <h3>2. Use <a href="https://pomodoro-tracker.com/">Pomodoro</a></h3>
            <p>Sometimes it may be a little hard to organize your time and Pomodoro helps you do it. It divides your tasks and makes it easy to learn (And work), I use it quite oftenly while coding. Using Pomodoro isn't really hard either, so it is definitely something you should check out.</p>
            <p>Now, you're ready to start learning ZarkonUI!ðŸ˜‹</p>
